John Conway

A solo project created out of the inspiration for Conway’s Game of Life. This project was an implementation of John
Conway’s Game of Life using the C language and Makefile as my C compiler. I also leveraged Git to keep my project’s
code backed up and secure. Currently working on an animation mode for indefinite generations. Included my University's parser code
enabling files to be downloaded off of https://conwaylife.com/ which is a wiki dedicated to his life and used as input to see how 
differnt starting generations can effect a lifetime.
