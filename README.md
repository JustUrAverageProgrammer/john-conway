John Conway

A solo project created out of the inspiration for Conway’s Game of Life. This project was an implementation of John
Conway’s Game of Life using the C language and Makefile as my C compiler. I also leveraged Git to keep my project’s
code backed up and secure. Currently working on an animation mode for indefinite generations.
